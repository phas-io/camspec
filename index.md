The CAMSPEC format (.cams/.camspec) is a file format designed to communicate manufacturing constraints and requirements between order management systems and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software. It enables precise specification of part orientation, positioning, and manufacturing constraints for multiple manufacturing processes.

The specification is under the MIT license. It is available for both commercial and non-commercial usage. 

The CAMSPEC format was developed by [Phasio](https://phas.io) and is currently maintained by the Phasio team.
